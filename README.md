# court_love

colour scheme
I used colours related to tennis with a shade of blue, red and green to reflect different surfaces hard court, clay and grass. Yellow is derived from the tennis ball colour, white is the line colour, and black will be the main text colour.

fonts
I used a font recommended with my logo from Canva from Daily Creative (https://www.canva.com/design/DAGr7kiK5zA/dRQFAGHjN97D28Y8rcLtyg/edit?ui=eyJHIjp7IkQiOnsiRCI6eyJBPyI6IkYifX19fQ): IBM Plex Sans. In google fonts, it was recommended to pair it with IBM Plex Serif (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif/about?preview.text=Court%20Love&query=IBM+Plex)
