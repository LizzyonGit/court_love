# court_love

colour scheme
I used colours related to tennis with a shade of blue, red and green to reflect different surfaces hard court, clay and grass. Yellow is derived from the tennis ball colour, white is the line colour, and black will be the main text colour.

fonts
I used a font recommended with my logo from Canva from Daily Creative (https://www.canva.com/design/DAGr7kiK5zA/dRQFAGHjN97D28Y8rcLtyg/edit?ui=eyJHIjp7IkQiOnsiRCI6eyJBPyI6IkYifX19fQ): IBM Plex Sans. In google fonts, it was recommended to pair it with IBM Plex Serif (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif/about?preview.text=Court%20Love&query=IBM+Plex)

Image with lesson
I wanted to have images with the lesson, even though it is not neccesary. So I did not want to give the user the possibility of uploading an image, as it is not neccessary, but I still want to give some choice to the user in which image will be used. So I fount this interesting option of using choices (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31948172/python-django-form-where-user-selects-from-a-list-of-images, by Pynchia), which seemed easy and enough for the MVP. To make this work, I also followed the instructions of Melvyn Sopacua here (https://groups.google.com/g/django-users/c/iP2TmUHwdDI).
